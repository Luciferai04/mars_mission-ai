# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) System

## Overview

The Mars Mission Planning Assistant now includes a **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** system that continuously learns optimal mission strategies through collaborative decision-making among 5 specialized AI agents.

---

##  The Five Specialized Agents

### 1. **Route Planning Agent**
- **Role:** Optimal path finding and navigation
- **Actions:** 8 directional movements (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
- **Learns:** 
  - Efficient routes to science targets
  - Hazard avoidance patterns
  - Power-efficient navigation
- **Reward Function:**
  - +50 for reaching targets
  - -10 per hazard level encountered
  - +5 for moving closer to objectives
  - -0.1 × power consumed

### 2. **Power Management Agent**
- **Role:** Battery and energy optimization
- **Actions:** 5 power modes (full, nominal, conservative, minimal, recharge)
- **Learns:**
  - Optimal battery usage patterns
  - When to conserve vs. use power
  - Charging strategy optimization
- **Reward Function:**
  - -100 for battery depletion (<10% SoC)
  - +10 for maintaining healthy levels (30-80%)
  - +30 for completing objectives with good power management
  - -5 for over-conservatism with available power

### 3. **Science Planning Agent**
- **Role:** Target selection and prioritization
- **Actions:** Select from top 10 science targets
- **Learns:**
  - High-value target identification
  - Diverse target selection
  - Time-efficient science operations
- **Reward Function:**
  - +100 for completing high-priority science
  - +50 for sample collection
  - +10 × diversity bonus (different target types)
  - +5 for quick operations (<30 min)

### 4. **Hazard Avoidance Agent**
- **Role:** Safety and risk management
- **Actions:** 4 risk tolerance levels (avoid_all, conservative, balanced, aggressive)
- **Learns:**
  - When to take calculated risks
  - Hazardous terrain identification
  - Safe operational boundaries
- **Reward Function:**
  - -200 for entering HAZARD terrain
  - -50 for CAUTION terrain
  - +20 for safe objective completion
  - Conservative bias toward safety

### 5. **Strategic Planning Agent**
- **Role:** Long-term mission optimization
- **Actions:** 6 strategy types (aggressive_exploration, systematic_survey, targeted_investigation, sample_collection, conservative_ops, opportunistic)
- **Learns:**
  - Multi-sol planning efficiency
  - Resource allocation over time
  - Seasonal/environmental adaptation
- **Reward Function:**
  - +100 × completion rate
  - +50 × objectives per sol efficiency
  - -30 for inefficient time management

##  How It Works

### Collaborative Decision-Making

The agents use **weighted voting** to coordinate actions:

```python
coordination_weights = {
    'route': 0.25,      # Primary movement decisions
    'power': 0.25,      # Energy constraints
    'science': 0.25,    # Target prioritization
    'hazard': 0.15,     # Safety veto power
    'strategy': 0.10    # Long-term guidance
}
```

**Decision Process:**
1. Each agent evaluates the current state
2. Agents propose actions based on their learned policies
3. Hazard agent can **veto** dangerous actions
4. Power agent can **limit** energy-intensive operations
5. Final action selected through weighted consensus

### Learning Algorithm

- **Method:** Q-Learning with ε-greedy exploration
- **State Space:** 9-dimensional feature vector:
  - Position (lat, lon)
  - Battery SoC
  - Time remaining (normalized)
  - Current sol
  - Temperature (normalized)
  - Dust opacity
  - Remaining targets
  - Completed objectives

- **Training:** 
  - Episodes simulate full mission scenarios
  - Agents learn from rewards/penalties
  - Exploration rate decays over time (ε: 1.0 → 0.01)
  - Experience replay for stable learning

##  Training the System

### Quick Start

```bash
# Train for 1000 episodes (recommended)

# Fast training (500 episodes)
python scripts/train_marl.py --episodes 500
```

##  Configuration

### Hyperparameters

Located in `src/core/multi_agent_rl.py`:

```python
# Learning rates (per agent)
RouteAgent: lr=0.001, γ=0.95
PowerAgent: lr=0.001, γ=0.98  # High γ for long-term power management
ScienceAgent: lr=0.001, γ=0.95
HazardAgent: lr=0.001, γ=0.99  # Highest γ for safety
StrategyAgent: lr=0.0005, γ=0.99  # Slower learning for strategy

# Exploration
epsilon_initial: 1.0
epsilon_decay: 0.995 per episode
epsilon_min: 0.01

# Replay buffer
capacity: 10,000 experiences per agent
```

### Tuning Recommendations

**For faster convergence:**
- Increase learning rates to 0.002-0.005
- Reduce epsilon_decay to 0.98

**For more stable learning:**
- Decrease learning rates to 0.0005
- Increase epsilon_decay to 0.997

**For more exploration:**
- Increase epsilon_min to 0.05
- Train for more episodes (2000+)
