##  How to Use Trained Models

### Option 1: Test via CLI

```bash
python scripts/train_marl.py --test
```

### Option 2: Use in Python Code

```python
from src.core.multi_agent_rl import MultiAgentRLSystem

# Initialize and load trained agents
marl = MultiAgentRLSystem()
marl.load_all_agents()

# Prepare mission context
context = {
    'lat': 18.4447,
    'lon': 77.4508,
    'battery_soc': 0.65,
    'time_budget_min': 480,
    'targets': [
        {'id': 'target_1', 'lat': 18.45, 'lon': 77.46, 'priority': 10}
    ],
    'sol': 1600,
    'temp': -65,
    'dust': 0.45
}

# Get optimized plan
result = marl.optimize_mission_plan(context)
print(f"RL Confidence: {result['rl_confidence']:.2%}")
print(f"Total Power: {result['total_power']:.1f} Wh")
```

### Option 3: Via API Endpoint (when integrated)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/optimize_with_marl \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "lat": 18.4447,
    "lon": 77.4508,
    "battery_soc": 0.65,
    "time_budget_min": 480,
    "targets": [
      {"id": "delta_sample_1", "lat": 18.45, "lon": 77.46, "priority": 10}
    ],
    "sol": 1600,
    "temp": -65,
    "dust": 0.45
  }'
```

##  Continuous Improvement

### Further Training (Optional)

To continue training from current checkpoint:

```bash
# Train for additional 500 episodes
python scripts/train_marl.py --episodes 500

# This will:
# - Load existing trained agents
# - Continue learning from current policies
# - Further reduce exploration (ε → 0.01)
# - Refine Q-value estimates
```
